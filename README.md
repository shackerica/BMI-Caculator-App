# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator


The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a Python program designed to calculate BMI based on weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. It provides a general indication of whether an individual falls within a healthy weight range, is underweight, overweight, or obese.

The program prompts the user to input their weight and height, and then calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height). It then displays the calculated BMI along with a corresponding interpretation of the BMI value, indicating whether the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese according to standard BMI ranges.

This program is helpful for individuals who want to monitor their weight and overall health. By providing a quick and easy way to calculate BMI, users can gain insights into their weight status and make informed decisions about their health and lifestyle.
